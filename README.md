# SentimentalAnalysis
A text classifier which predicts the sentiments of the statement

I have used a self made dataset which contains of 5 statements and its labels
if you have a better data set which you want to use , you just change the input directory
and you also have to clean and processes your data , which means you basically have to remove all the commas , fullstop and other symbols
your 'review' should only contain small case alphabet

and your label should be 1 or 0 where
1 = positive and
0 = negetive
